A News text classification project.

The idea is to classify the text given into what kind of news.

The model is trained with Business,Entertainment, Politics, Sports, Tech news.

Here is a django project, with a simple UI having a textarea and a button.
Paste any text and submitting will show the text you entered and the class which that text belongs.
